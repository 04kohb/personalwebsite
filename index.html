    <h1>Leadership</h1>
      <p>I co-founded the Singapore Student Association in Arizona State Univerisity in 2019

In addition I have partnered with Universities in the west coast from Berkeley, Standford, UCLA, UW, University of Arizona to host social events for Singaporean students to help students make new frirends during the pandemic.

  <h3>Surbana Jurong Internship Project</h3>
  <img src="RPIProj.png" alt= "RPI" id="img7">
  <p> I created a simple lift monitoring device by writing a C program using Raspberry Pi and serial communication (UART) to transmit information between the Raspberry Pi and the laptop to send lift fault messages. This project is significant because most of the software and hardware of Lift Monitoring devices are developed my external companies. This project was created to help Surbana Jurong study lift monitoring devices so they can devep their own lift monitoring software in the future.</p>
